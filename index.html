			<P><STRONG>Overview</STRONG></P>
			<P>This repository contains port of Suricata to Tilera's multi
			core processors. The intent of this repository is to collect work
			in progress on the Suricata port to Tilera and make it available
			to the community. Ultimately the modifications to Suricata to
			support Tilera are expected to be folded back into the Suricata
			source base maintained by OISF.</P>
			<P>This supports Suricata on Tile64, TilePRO and TileGX
			processors. Although the main focus has been Suricata on the
			TileGX-36 processor.</P>
			<P>The code has been run on both Tilempower and Tilempower-GX
			platforms. The code should execute on Tilera's Tile-PCI cards as
			well.</P>
			<P>The initial effort at supporting Suricata on Tilera is to
			support operation as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Follow
			on work to support inline IPS operation will be come later. IPS
			operation relies on iptables. At this point the behavior of
			iptables on Tilera's Linux isn't well understood.</P>
			<P>Suricata on Tilera should support all of the accompanying tools
			found alongside Suricata (ex. Barnyard). although exhaustive
			testing of each has not been accomplished.</P>
			<P><STRONG>Prerequisites for Suricata on Tilera</STRONG></P>
			<P>Suricata for Tilera is provided in source code form. 
			</P>
			<P>For Tile64 and TilePro based systems you'll need:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tilera MDE 3.0. or later from
				Tilera 
				</P>
				<LI><P>A suitable Tilera based platform from Tilera or one of
				their hardware partners. 
				</P>
			</UL>
			<P>For TileGX based systems you'll need:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tilera MDE 4.0beta1 or later
				from Tilera 
				</P>
				<LI><P>A suitable Tilera based TileGX platform from Tilera. 
				</P>
			</UL>
			<P><STRONG>Acquiring Suricata for Tilera</STRONG></P>
			<P>This repository contains the source code for Suricata. Suricata
			requires this libyaml and libmagic which aren't delivered by the
			Tilera Multicore Development Envionment (MDE). Copies of these
			libraries have been made available here on github with
			instructions on building them. These copies of libyaml and
			libmagic have been tested with suricata on Tilera and are known to
			work. You may however use alternate versions of these libraries if
			you desire.</P>
			<P>For assistance with acquiring Tilera hardware and development
			tools visit
			<A HREF="http://www.tilera.com/about_tilera/contact/contact_form">http://www.tilera.com/about_tilera/contact/contact_form</A>
			.</P>
			<P>Retrieve the source code for Suricata, libyaml and libmagic as
			follows:</P>
			<P><CODE CLASS="western">git clone
			git@github.com:decanio/suricata.git</CODE></P>
			<P><CODE CLASS="western">git clone git@github.com:decanio/yaml.git</CODE></P>
			<P><CODE CLASS="western">git clone
			git@github.com:decanio/libmagic.git</CODE></P>
			<P><STRONG>Building Suricata for Tilera</STRONG></P>
			<P>Both the libyaml and libmagic libraries must be build prior to
			building Suricata for Tilera.</P>
			<P>Build libyaml as follows:</P>
			<P><CODE CLASS="western">cd yaml</CODE></P>
			<P><CODE CLASS="western">./configure --host=tile</CODE></P>
			<P><CODE CLASS="western">make</CODE></P>
			<P>Build libmagic as follows:</P>
			<P><CODE CLASS="western">cd libmagic</CODE></P>
			<P><CODE CLASS="western">./configure --host=tile</CODE></P>
			<P><CODE CLASS="western">make</CODE></P>
			<P><STRONG>Building Suricata for TileGX</STRONG></P>
			<P>The file doc/INSTALL.TILERA contains written instructions on
			building Suricata for both the TilePro and TileGX architectures.</P>
			<P>A Makefile tile/Makefile.tilegx has been provided that
			automates building suricata with the build target &quot;build_static&quot;.
			This performs most of the operations required to build suricata
			for Tilera.</P>
			<P>Suricata for TileGX can be built as follows:</P>
			<P><CODE CLASS="western">cd suricata</CODE></P>
			<P><CODE CLASS="western">./autogen.sh</CODE></P>
			<P><CODE CLASS="western">make -f tile/Makefile.tilegx build_static</CODE></P>
			<P><STRONG>Preconfigured Tilera based Suricata Systems</STRONG></P>
			<P>If you would like a system with suricata for Tilera already
			installed please contact <A HREF="mailto:decanio.tom@gmail.com">decanio.tom@gmail.com</A>
			for assistance.</P>
			<P><STRONG>Running Suricata on TileGX</STRONG></P>
			<P>Suricata runs on Tilera based platforms much as it runs on
			typical Intel based platforms.</P>
			<P>Copy the suricata binary, built above, and your suricata
			configuration files to your Tilera platform.</P>
			<P>Execute suricata with a command such as the following:</P>
			<P><CODE CLASS="western">suricata -c
			/opt/suricata/etc/suricata.yaml -I xgbe3</CODE></P>
			<P>The Tilera version of suricata uses the -I <EM>&lt;dev&gt;</EM>
			option in place of the usual -i <EM>&lt;dev&gt;</EM> option. On
			the Tilera platform <EM>&lt;dev&gt;</EM> is the mpipe interface
			name of the ethernet interface you would like suricata to monitor.
			The 10 gigabit interface names are typically xgbe1, xgbe2, xgbe3
			and xgbe4. The 1 gigabit interface names are typically gbe1, gbe2,
			gbe3 and gbe4.</P>
